# Rock-Paper-Scissor
Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮✨ This is a classic Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, developed as part of my learning journey . The game allows players to compete against a computer opponent with simple yet interactive gameplay.
🔹 Features:
✔️ User-friendly interface with clean UI 🎨
✔️ Instant result display (Win, Lose, or Draw) 🏆

This project helped me enhance my JavaScript skills, especially in handling user interactions, event listeners, and randomization. Check it out and test your luck! 🚀
